# Notes while editing on 2017-Aug-08 by Jesse Bloom
* First paragraph, first section of Results: 
    - First sentence: I have simplified *"In order to understand influenza replication dynamics we measured the transcriptome of individual cells using a droplet-based system -- physically isolating cells prior to performing reverse-transcription."* to just be a simpler sentence that says what we did directly. The current sentence is too complex. I think the end of the Introduction will probably introduce the concept of what we are doing and why, so we probably don't need to repeat that here.
    - Last sentence: This sentence was also a bit complex, so I've broken it into two sentences each with one thought.

* Second paragraph, first section of Results:
    - It seemed important to mention the viral strain somewhere early, so I added that.
    - Re-worded to indicate that co-infected cells with **often** express mRNAs from both virus barcodes. It won't happen if they get co-infected with the same barcode.

* Figure 1 legend:
    - I have shortened the first sentence to just say *"Experimental overview"* because I think the other title was too complex to be useful. I've also tried to clarify other parts.
    - I have removed the part about the mRNA numbering being in mRNA coordinates in panel A. I do think this is an important point, but it's too subtle and complex to make here. In fact, I think it would be better to **remove the mRNA sequencing numbering from panel A altogether.** It's not really important for conceptually understanding the idea, , and we give the full vRNA sequences in the figure source data.
    - I created the source data with the vRNA sequences.
