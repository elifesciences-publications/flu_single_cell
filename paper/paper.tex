\section{Introduction}

Heterogeneity is important in a lot of cellular processes even when isogenic~\citep{shalek2013single,shalek2014single}.

Population (genetic) heterogeneity is also important. 
Viral quasispecies, cancer single-cell, etc.
Salmonella paper (PhoP).

Literature on viral burst-size heterogeneity.
This goes back to Delbruck, Andino polio paper~\citep{schulte2014single}, the MDCK / flu paper.

Discuss segmented nature of influenza.
Maybe in the context of how this could further increase heterogeneity because there is a lot of potential for entire genes to be missing.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Strategy to measure mRNA in single virus-infected cells.}
We performed single-cell mRNA sequencing using a droplet-based system that physically isolates individual cells prior to reverse transcription.
Each droplet is associated with a unique \emph{cell barcode} that tags all mRNAs from that cell during reverse-transcription.
A random \emph{unique molecular identifier (UMI)} is additionally appended to each mRNA molecule during reverse transcription.
The 3' ends of the mRNAs are sequenced and mapped to the human and influenza virus transcriptomes to determine transcript identities.
This information is combined with that provided by the UMIs and cell barcodes to quantify the number of molecules of each mRNA species that have been captured for each cell.

Infected cells will express viral as well as cellular mRNAs -- however the cell barcodes and UMIs cannot distinguish whether a cell was initially infected by one or multiple viral particles.
We therefore engineered an influenza virus (strain A/WSN/1933) that additionally carried \emph{viral barcodes} consisting of synonymous mutations near the 3' end of each transcript (Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}A).
Critically, these synonymous mutations did not greatly impact viral growth kinetics (Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}B).
We infected A549 human lung carcinoma cells with an equal mix of the wild-type and synonymously barcoded viruses.
Cells infected by a single virion will exclusively express mRNAs from either wild-type or synonymously barcoded virus, whereas cells that are co-infected with multiple virions will often express mRNAs from both the wild-type and synonymously barcoded viruses (Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}C).

A549 cells were infected with an equal mixture of mutant and wild-type virus. 
Immediately prior to sequencing, cells were physically separated into droplets and cDNA libraries were generated containing the indicated barcodes. 
The libraries were deep sequenced, and the data processed to create a matrix that gives the number of molecules of each transcript observed in each cell.
Infected cells were further annotated by whether their viral mRNAs derived from wild-type virus, synonymously barcoded virus, or both.

We took care to generate stocks of virus that were relatively ``pure'' of defective particles.
Stocks of viruses typically contain an array of biologically active viral particles, some of which are defective for replication owing to mutations or deletions in essential viral genes.
These defective particles become prevalent when a virus is grown at high multiplicity of infection (MOI), where complementation permits the growth of otherwise deleterious genotypes.
To minimize the levels of defective particles, we propagated our viral stocks at low MOI for a relatively brief period of time~\citep{xue2016propagation}.
We then validated that our stocks exhibited greater purity of infectious particles than a stock propagated at high MOI by verifying that they had a higher ratio of infectious particles to both virion RNA (Figure~\ref{fig:viruspopulations}A) and particles capable of inducing expression of a single viral protein (Figure~\ref{fig:viruspopulations}B).
In addition, viral stocks with many defective particles are more immunostimulatory~\citep{tapia2013defective}.
We confirmed that our viral stocks induced much less interferon than a stock propagated at higher MOI (Figure~\ref{fig:viruspopulations}C).

\subsection{Single cells show a wide range of expression of viral transcripts.}
We infected A549 cells at low MOI with a mixture of the wild-type and synonymously barcoded viruses, and collected cells for sequencing at 6, 8, and 10 hours post-infection, including a replicate of the 8-hour timepoint.
We recovered between 3,000 and 4,000 cells for each sample (Figure~\ref{fig:cells}A). 
As expected for a low-MOI infection, most cells expressed little or no viral mRNA (Figure~\ref{fig:cells}B).
Also as expected, the amount of viral mRNA per cell among infected cells increased over time (Figure~\ref{fig:cells}B).
But what was most notable was how widely the number of viral mRNA molecules varied among infected cells.
While the fraction of mRNA derived from virus was $<$0.1\% for most cells, viral mRNA constituted close to half the transcriptome in a few cells at 8 and 10 hours (Figure~\ref{fig:cells}C).
%Therefore, there is extraordinary variability in the number of viral transcripts per infected cell.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

A complicating factor is that uninfected cells could have small amounts of viral mRNA due to leakage of transcripts from lysed cells.
It is therefore important to establish a threshold for identifying truly infected cells.
We can do this by taking advantage of the fact that roughly half the infecting virions bear synonymous barcodes.
Reads derived from lysed cells will be drawn from both wild-type and synonymously barcoded viral transcripts.
However, most cells are infected by at most one virion, and so the reads from truly infected cells will usually derive almost entirely from one of the two viral variants. 
Figure~\ref{fig:viralbarcodes}A shows the fraction of viral reads in individual cells from each viral variant, and Figure~\ref{fig:viralbarcodes}B indicates the fraction of viral reads from the most abundant variant in that cell.
Most cells with large amounts of viral mRNA have viral transcripts exclusively derived from one viral variant -- indicating non-random partitioning as expected from viral infection.
However, cells with a small amount of viral mRNA often have viral transcripts from both variants, as expected from the random partitioning associated with simple mRNA leakage.
Finally, a few cells with large amounts of viral mRNA have viral transcripts from both variants, reflecting co-infection with both variants.

We determined the threshold amount of viral mRNA per cell at which the barcode partitioning clearly resulted from infection rather than leakage (Figure~\ref{fig:viralbarcodes}C), and used this threshold to annotate cells that we were confident were truly infected.
We also annotated as co-infected cells above this threshold that had mRNA from both viral variants.
Figure~\ref{fig:viralbarcodes}D shows the number of cells annotated as infected and co-infected for each sample -- these cells are just a small fraction of the number of cells with any viral read.
These annotation thresholds are conservative, and will miss some true low-level infections, as well as any co-infections with the same viral variant.
However, it is important that the analyses below are restricted to cells that are truly infected with virus, so we accepted the loss of some low-level infections in order to avoid false positives.
Because the bulk of cells are not infected, we subsampled the uninfected cells to the numbers shown in Figure~\ref{fig:viralbarcodes}D to balance the proportions of infected and uninfected cells for all subsequent analyses.

Strikingly, the extreme variation in the number of viral transcripts per cell remains even after we apply these rigorous criteria for annotating infected cells (Figure~\ref{fig:viralbarcodes}E). 
The fraction of viral mRNA per infected cell follows a roughly exponential distribution, with many cells having few viral transcripts and a few cells having many.
In fact, a bare few infected cells contribute the majority of influenza transcripts.
Specifically, at 6 and 8 hours $<$10\% of infected cells are responsible for over half the viral transcripts, while at 10 hours $\approx$15\% of infected cells produce over half the viral transcripts (Figure~\ref{fig:viralbarcodes}-Figure~supplement~\ref{figsupp:cumulfracflu}).

\subsection{Absence of viral genes partially explains cell-to-cell variability in viral transcript abundance.}
The influenza genome is segmented, and cells can fail to express a viral mRNA if the encoding gene segment is not packaged in the infecting virion or fails to initiate transcription after infection.
Indeed, several groups have reported that the majority of infected cells fail to express at least one viral gene~\citep{brooke2013most}. 
We wondered if the absence of specific viral genes might be associated with reduced amounts of viral mRNA within single infected cells.
In particular, transcription of influenza virus mRNAs is performed by the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which consists of the three proteins that encode the tripartite polymerase (PB2, PB1, and PA) as well as nucleoprotein (NP).
Each viral gene segment is associated with one RNP in incoming infecting virions, but secondary transcription by newly synthesized RNPs requires the presence of the viral genes for each of the four constituent RNP proteins.
This secondary transcription is a major source of viral mRNAs, as evidenced by the fact that blocking synthesis of the RNP proteins reduces the amount of viral mRNA by several orders of magnitude in bulk cells (Figure~\ref{fig:fluburdenbyflugene}-Figure~supplement~\ref{figsupp:cyclohexamide}).

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/p_flu_burden_flu_gene_merge.pdf}}

The absence of viral genes explains some of the variability in the amount of viral mRNA per cell.

Cells with high viral burden always express all the RNP genes, but some cells with high viral burden lack each of the other viral genes.
{\bf (B)}
Box plots showing the per-cell viral burden among cells with $>$0.5\% of their mRNA from virus, binned by whether or not the cells express each viral gene.
A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test the null hypothesis that absence of each gene does not affect viral burden: **** = $P < 10^{-4}$, *** = $P < 10^{-3}$,  * = $P < 0.05$.
Similar results are obtained if we examine only the 10-hour timepoint (Figure~\ref{fig:fluburdenbyflugene}-Figure~supplement~\ref{figsupp:10hrfluburdenbyflugene}).
{\bf (C)}
Fraction of infected cells that express all four RNP genes and also express each of the four other genes, as well as the fraction that express \emph{all} four of the other genes.
The fraction of cells that express all four other genes is well predicted by simply multiplying the frequencies of cells that express each of these genes individually, indicating that gene absence is approximately independent across these four genes.
}
\figsupp[Secondary transcription from newly synthesized RNPs is a major source of viral mRNA during bulk infections.\label{figsupp:cyclohexamide}]{
A549 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.2 as calculated on MDCK-SIAT1 cels in either the presence or absence of the protein-translation inhibitor cyclohexamide, and viral mRNA was quantified at 8 hours post-infection by qPCR.
The cyclohexamide prevents translation of new PB2, PB1, PA, and NP protein, and so prevents the formation of the new RNPs needed for secondary transcription.
The bars show the relative amount of HA and PB2 mRNA in the absence versus the presence of cyclohexamide.

\figsupp[Like panel (B) but for the 10-hr sample only.\label{figsupp:10hrfluburdenbyflugene}]{
The absence of viral RNP genes but \emph{not} non-RNP genes remains significantly associated with reduced viral burden when we examine only the 10-hr sample, which is the single time point with the most data points.
The difference for NP is no longer statistically significant due to low counts of infected cells lacking NP, but the trend remains.
}{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/p_10hr_flu_burden_flu_gene_test}}
\figdata{The numerical data for panel (C) are in \texttt{p\_missing\_genes.csv}.}
\end{figure}

We examined the total fraction of mRNA in each cell that derives from virus versus the relative expression of each viral gene (Figure~\ref{fig:fluburdenbyflugene}A). 
Cells that lack an RNP gene never derive more than a few percent of their mRNAs from virus, demonstrating that the presence of these RNP genes is essential for high levels of viral transcription.
However, we observe cells that lack each of the other non-RNP genes but still derive $\approx$40\% of their mRNAs from virus, suggesting that none of the other genes are important for high levels of viral transcription.
These results are statistically supported by the analysis in Figure~\ref{fig:fluburdenbyflugene}B, which shows that absence of any RNP gene but \emph{not} any of the other viral genes is associated with reduced amounts of viral mRNA. 
However, gene absence clearly does not explain all of the variability in viral gene expression, since even cells expressing all viral genes exhibit a very wide distribution in the amount of viral mRNA that they express. 
The rest of this variability must be due to additional mechanisms such as differences in host-cell state, viral mutations not detectable by our 3'-end sequencing approach, or inherent stochasticity.  

We also sought to quantify the fraction of infected cells that completely failed to express a given gene.
We limited this analysis to examining the presence / absence of the non-RNP genes in cells expressing all four RNP genes, since we might fail to detect viral transcripts that are actually present at low levels in RNP-deficient cells due to the lower viral burden in these cells.
At the 8- and 10-hour time points, between 5\% and 17\% of cells fail to express any one of the four non-RNP genes (Figure~\ref{fig:fluburdenbyflugene}C).
The absence of a given gene appears to be an independent event, as the probability of observing all four non-RNP genes in a cell is well predicted by simply multiplying the probabilities of observing each gene individually (Figure~\ref{fig:fluburdenbyflugene}C). 
Our measurements of the frequency at which infected cells fail to express individual viral genes are roughly consistent with measurements made by others using different means~\citep{brooke2013most}.
	
\subsection{The relative amounts of different viral mRNAs are fairly consistent across cells.}
The results above show that the total amount of viral mRNA in infected cells varies over orders of magnitude.
Does the relative expression of viral genes exhibit similar cell-to-cell variability?
To address this question, we focused on cells that derived $>$5\% of their mRNA from virus, since estimates of relative viral gene expression will be less noisy in cells with more viral mRNAs.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/p_flu_expr_aledit.pdf}}

}
\figdata{The raw data are in \texttt{p\_flu\_expr.csv}.}
\end{figure}

In contrast to the extreme variability in the total viral mRNA per cell, the fraction of this mRNA derived from each gene is much more consistent across cells (Figure~\ref{fig:fluexpr}A).
Total viral mRNA varies by orders of magnitude, but the fraction from any given viral gene is fairly tightly clustered around the median value for all cells (Figure~\ref{fig:fluexpr}B).
The median fractions of viral mRNA from each gene in our cells are similar to prior bulk measurements made on large numbers of infected cells by Northern blots~\citep{hatada1989control}, which also found an expression hierarchy of M $>$ NS $\gg$ NP $>$ NA $>$ HA $\gg$ PB2 $\sim$ PB1 $\sim$ PA.
The cell-to-cell consistency in the relative expression of different viral genes generally becomes even tighter if we limit the analysis only to cells that express all eight viral genes (Figure~\ref{fig:fluexpr}C,D).
Therefore, with the exception of complete gene absence, the factors that drive the dramatic cell-to-cell variability in the amount of viral mRNA appear to have roughly similar effects on all viral genes in a given cell.
This finding is consistent with prior work showing positive correlations among the abundance of several viral gene segments in individual cells.

\subsection{Co-infection potentially increases successful viral infections}
While relatively rare in our dataset, those cells positively identified as containing both wild-type and synonymously barcoded influenza provide important insight into the nature of co-infection. 
It has been posited that co-infection can rescue infections missing one or more segments, potentially by providing missing genome equivalents.
\emph{Brooke et al}, for example observed increased co-occurrence of a given gene-segment pair as MOI was increased. 
Consistent with this model, we frequently observe a single barcode for a given gene segment, suggesting it was only provided by one virion (Figure ~\ref{fig:coexpression}).
This interpretation does however, make the assumption that absence is not instead driven by competition between segments.
When we examine our co-infected cells, we observe a higher rate of co-expression of the four non-RNP segments than calculated above (80\% as compared to 63-70\%), with the caveat that this is an incredibly small sample size to draw from.
Another observation that can be immediately procured is that, on the whole, co-infections have roughly balanced amounts of wild-type and barcoded segments. 
Others have noted that windows for co-infection are relatively narrow, and, these data suggest that the co-infections we observe likely occurred before significant genome replication -- a process which would dramatically advantage the earlier virion.
To support these conclusions using a larger dataset, we generated a virus in which the HA segment was replaced by GFP, allowing us to detect co-infection by both wild-type and mutant virus by flow cytometry (Figure ~\ref{fig:flowcyto}A).
When we examine strictly co-infected cells, we observe that, as in our single-cell analysis, both HA and GFP are highly correlated -- indicating a tight window of co-infection (Figure ~\ref{fig:flowcyto}B).
Moreover, a portion of the population expressing only low HA, which likely includes those viruses only engaging in primary transcription, is greatly reduced, suggesting rescue of this phenotype by co-infection (Figure ~\ref{fig:flowcyto}C). 
These data give credence to the sentiments of others that co-infection may be a significant contributor to influenza pathogenesis.

\subsection{Identifying host features of influenza infection}
Single cell measurements not only allow us to observe heterogeneity with respect to progression through a process, but also to capture cell states of subpopulations within complex mixtures.
Prior measurements of the host response to influenza have been confounded by the complexity of the infectious process, visualizing only the magnitude of a response -- blind to the prevalence of response in the population or its specific association with infection state.
To begin to understand the cellular response to influenza, or, alternatively, influenza remodeling of the cellular state, we first needed to understand whether we have the power to distinguish features associated with in.

We therefore undertook tSNE analysis to determine whether influenza drives changes in transcriptomic state above-and-beyond between-cell variability independent of infection. 
When visualized in two-dimensions, we find that unsupervised clustering does indeed indicate an overal
