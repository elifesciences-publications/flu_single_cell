\begin{abstract}
Influenza virus infection induces large changes in cellular transcription.
Previously this has mostly been looked at using bulk measurements
Here we examine the process at the level of single cells.
We find extremely wide variation in the extent of viral gene transcription across infected cells.
IFN induction is very rare.
Some cellular pathways may be consistently altered in cells with high burden of viral transcripts.
Overall, highlights remarkable heterogeneity in the outcome of infection.

\section{Introduction}

Heterogeneity is important in a lot of cellular processes even when isogenic~\citep{shalek2013single,shalek2014single}.

Population (genetic) heterogeneity is also important. 
Viral quasispecies, cancer single-cell, etc.
Salmonella paper (PhoP).

Literature on viral burst-size heterogeneity.
This goes back to Delbruck, Andino polio paper~\citep{schulte2014single}, the MDCK / flu paper.

Discuss segmented nature of influenza.
Maybe in the context of how this could further increase heterogeneity because there is a lot of potential for entire genes to be missing.
Includes Yewdell and Lowen papers.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Strategy to measure mRNA in single virus-infected cells.}
In order to understand influenza replication dynamics we measured the transcriptome of individual cells using a droplet-based system -- physically isolating cells prior to performing reverse-transcription.
Each droplet is associated with a unique \emph{cell barcode} that tags all mRNAs from that cell during reverse-transcription.
A random \emph{unique molecular identifier (UMI)} is additionally appended to each mRNA molecule during reverse transcription.
Sequencing the 3' ends of the mRNAs provides transcript identity, that, when combined with the UMI and cell barcode, allows the measurement of the number of different molecules of each mRNA species captured per cell.

Infected cells will express viral as well as cellular mRNAs, however the cell barcodes and UMIs cannot distinguish whether a cell was initially infected by one or multiple viral particles.
We therefore engineered an influenza virus that additionally carried \emph{viral barcodes} consisting of synonymous mutations near the 3' end of each transcript (Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}A).
Critically, these mutations did not dramatically impact viral growth kinetics. (Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}B).
We infected A549 human lung carcinoma cells with an equal mix of the wildtype and synonymously barcoded viruses.
Cells infected by a single virion should exclusively express mRNAs from either wild-type or synonymously barcoded virus, whereas cells that are co-infected with multiple virions should instead express mRNAs from both the wildtype and synonymously barcoded viruses (Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}C).

Using a reverse-phase emulsion, cells are physically separated and cDNA libraries are generated containing the indicated barcodes. Subsequent amplification and sequencing of libraries permits the identification and assignation of transcript abundances to individual cells. Additional information from our influenza synonymous barcode allows for the generation of categorical data with respect to infection. Data are used to generate a cell-gene-category matrix containing the totality of our observations regarding the cell transcriptome and infection state for further analysis. Abbreviations: WT -- wild-type, Syn -- Synonymous Barcode.

We also took care to generate stocks of virus that we expected to be relatively ``pure.''
Many viruses, including influenza, rapidly diversify into an array of biologically active viral particles, some of which are defective for replication owing to mutations or deletions in essential viral genes -- or even lack one or more gene segments altogether.
For influenza virus, one abundant form of these defective particles arises from deletions that occur in the three viral segments encoding the tripartite viral polymerase.
These particles become prevalent when the virus is grown at high multiplicities of infection, where complementation by co-infection permits the growth of otherwise deleterious genotypes.
To keep the level of these defective particles as low as possible, we propagated our viral populations at low multiplicity of infection for a relatively brief period of time~\citep{xue2016propagation}.
We then validated that, compared to virus propagated at high multiplicity of infections, our viral populations exhibited a much greater purity of infectious particles.
In contrast to a high defective population, our ``pure" viral stocks exhibited a much lower ratio of viral-RNA molecules to infectious particles (Figure~\ref{fig:viruspopulations}A) and infectious particles to particles that induce cellular expression of a single viral protein (Figure~\ref{fig:viruspopulations}B).
Additionally, from the work of \emph{Tapia et al} as well as others, we know that high defective populations are significantly more immunostimulatory than their more ``pure" counterparts.
We therefore confirmed that our viral populations induced much less interferon than a population propagated at higher multiplicity of infection. (Figure~\ref{fig:viruspopulations}D).

\subsection{Single infected cells show a wide range of expression of viral transcripts.}
We infected cells at a low multiplicity of infection with a mixture of the wildtype and synonymously barcoded viral populations and collected cells for mRNA sequencing at 6, 8, and 10 hours, including a replicate of the 8-hour timepoint.
We recovered roughly 3,000 to 4,000 cells for each sample (Figure~\ref{fig:cells}A). 
As expected, most cells expressed little or no viral mRNA (Figure~\ref{fig:cells}B).
However, a small fraction of cells expressed substantial numbers of viral mRNA molecules -- exceeding 10,000 in a few cells from the 10-hour timepoint (Figure~\ref{fig:cells}C). 
Consistent with known influenza replication kinetics, viral transcripts are observed to make up an increasing proportion of the total mRNA, although there was also very wide cell-to-cell variability in the number of viral transcripts at each time point (Figure~\ref{fig:cells}C).

\end{figure}

When calling infected cells we must be aware that uninfected cells could have small amounts of viral mRNA due to leakage of transcripts from lysed cells.
It is therefore important to establish a threshold for identifying truly infected cells.
We can do this by taking advantage of our use of both wild-type and synonymously barcoded viruses.
Reads derived from lysed cells should exhibit random partitioning among cells, and therefore cells that contain viral mRNA exclusively acquired  through leakage should more frequently exhibit cooccurrence of viral barcodes.
Conversely, most infected cells will be infected by only a single virion, and so their reads should derive almost exclusively from one of the two viral barcodes. 

Figure~\ref{fig:viralbarcodes}A shows the fraction of viral reads in individual cells that are derived from each viral barcode, and Figure~\ref{fig:viralbarcodes}B indicates the fraction of viral reads from the most abundant barcode in that cell.
As is clear from this figure, most cells expressing a large number of viral transcripts have these transcripts exclusively derived from just one of the viral barcodes -- indicating non-random partitioning as expected from viral infection.
A very small fraction of these cells express viral transcripts with both barcodes, presumably indicating rare co-infection events.
However, cells expressing a small number of viral transcripts often have a mixture of the two viral barcodes, as predicted by random partitioning from simple mRNA leakage (Figure~\ref{fig:viralbarcodes}B).
We therefore determined a threshold for the minimum amount of viral RNA that was present in cells in which the barcode partitioning appeared to result from infection rather than leakage (Figure~\ref{fig:viralbarcodes}C), and used this threshold to annotate all cells that we were confident were truly infected with virus.
Strikingly, among the infected the cells at each time point, a bare few contribute the majority of influenza transcripts (Figure~\ref{fig:viralbarcodes}D).
Specifically, at the 6 and 8-hour timepoints 10\% or less of the infected cells are responsible for over half the viral transcripts, while at the 10-hour timepoint 15\% of the infected cells produce over half the viral transcripts (Figure~\ref{fig:viralbarcodes}-Figure~supplement~\ref{figsupp:cumulfracflu}).

\subsection{Many infected cells are non-productive, explaining partially the broad distribution of viral gene expression.}

It is thought that a major driver of variation in influenza productivity is the segmented nature of the influenza genome.
Several groups have described that the majority of infections fail to express at least one of the eight influenza segments. 
We make a similar observation (Figure~\ref{fig:fluburdenbyflugene}A). 
When we bin cells according to absence of a given segment we observe that, unsurprisingly, absence of the tripartite polymerase (PB1, PA, PB2) and nuceoprotein (NP) correlates strongly with decreased influenza burden (Figure~\ref{fig:fluburdenbyflugene}B). 
Importantly, the gene products of all four of these segments are essential to the transition from primary mRNA transcription to replication and secondary mRNA transcription. 
This effect cannot be solely attributed to sampling error, as the polymerase genes exhibit the lowest expression and thus would be expected to be stochastically lost due to undersurveillance at much higher influenza transcript levels than would other genes. 
Nevertheless, while segment absence can partially explain extreme components of influenza variability resulting from an inability to fully engage in secondary transcription, absence of the remaining segments does not appear to have any significant impact on influenza burden.
Importantly, even cells expressing all eight segments still exhibit a wide distribution of influenza transcripts within each time point. We must instead therefore posit alternative mechanisms such as variability in host cells to explain the remainder of this distribution.  

We further wished to define metrics for presence/absence for a given segment and compare them to values obtained for other strains of influenza in order to understand the probability that a given infection could possibly produce infectious progeny. 
However, we decided to omit these calculations for PB1, PA, PB2, and NP due to the confounding effect of decreased influenza transcript abundance. 
In support of this decision, when we use cyclohexamide treatment to limit cells to primary transcription alone, we find a 2-3 log reduction in mRNA levels of PB1 or HA relative to a 10h time point (supplemental figure). 
We therefore lack confidence that our approach has the power to detect all semi-infectious events that result from a lack of polymerase or nucleoprotein segments.
However, given the lack of effect absence of other segments appears to have on mRNA production, we proceeded to calculate the relative abundance of infectious events absent a given gene segment for those time points in which we have relatively robust measurements of influenza (8h, 10h).

\subsection{Influenza mRNA Ratios are Tightly Controlled}
	
	This and other reports have described the considerable heterogeneity produced as influenza infection progresses in tissue culture models. However, in stark contrast to our analyses above, the ratios of mRNAs generated by the eight segments appear to behave in a highly stereotyped fashion, with values roughly consistent with prior Northern Blot measurements of Influenza mRNA abundance. Staggeringly, this is true whether or not cells are expressing mRNAs from all eight segments, at all three time points,  and, in cells running the gamut of infectious burden -- although we must limit these conclusions to those cells engaging in secondary transcription given the caveats described above. Therefore while either noise in influenza replication or host variability can dramatically impact the amount of Influneza mRNA produced as a whole, these processes seem to, ignoring complete absence of a segment, act equally across the Influenza genome. This is consistent with more limited measurements showing positive correlations between several segments in vRNA measurements in single cells. It would therefore be inadvisable to search for the sources of the broad distribution in influenza replication in those steps that can impact segments independently of one-another, such as noise in the transition to cRNA or vRNA production, but rather only in those processes that could impact the kinetics of all segments equivalently, such as transport to the nucleus or availability of cellular resources. 


\subsection{co-infection Occurs Early and Is Likely Adaptive For Influenza}
	While relatively rare in our dataset, those cells positively identified as containing both wild-type and synonymously barcoded influenza provide important insight into the nature of co-infection. It has been posited that co-infection can rescue nonproductive infections, potentially by providing missing genome equivalents. Brooke et al., for example observed increased co-occurrence of a given gene-segment pair as MOI was increased. When we examine our co-infected cells, we observe a much higher rate of expression of all eight segments (metric). Consistent with this model, we also observe that if we consider only one barcode or the other, that many of these infections would instead have been non-productive. Another observation that can be immediately procured is that, on the whole, co-infections have roughly balanced amounts of wild-type and barcoded segments. Others have noted that windows for co-infection are relatively narrow, and, these data directly suggest that this window is specifically narrow with respect to cRNA and vRNA production. If significant replication of viral genomes had already occurred, one would expect a much wider distribution of ratios than those observed. To support these observations, we used a virus in which the HA segment was replaced by GFP, allowing us to detect co-infection by this modified virus and wild-type WSN by flow cytometry. When we examine strictly co-infected cells, we observe that, as in our single-cell analysis, both HA and GFP are highly correlated -- indicating a tight window of co-infection -- and that a peak of low HA -- likely corresponding to primary transcription alone -- is greatly reduced. These data give credence to the sentiments of others that non-productive events are perhaps just productive events waiting to occur, and that the true dynamics underlying descriptions of ?MOI? are far more complex than we frequently give them credence and rely on assumptions that frequently prove incorrect.
